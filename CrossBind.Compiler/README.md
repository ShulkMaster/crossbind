# CrossBind Front Compiler

This project does not work by itself, it only provides all the tools to convert from source code to CMU
structures and error handling.

This is separatly distributed from the CLI for those people who wish to write their
own version of the rest of the compiler without having to deal with the
first stage of compilation or worry about language standards and parsing.
